The material within the chapters of this dissertation are largely taken from previously published (or soon to be published) articles. The following text identifies these articles, and provides some additional context about how they relate to one another.

\subsubsection*{Chapter 1 - Evaluating the relationship between the area and latitude of large igneous provinces and Earth's long-term climate state}

\noindent
\bibentry{Macdonald2019a}

\medskip

\bibentry{Park2019a}

\bigskip

In \citet{Macdonald2019a}, I developed a workflow built on pyGPlates (software for the analysis of paleogeographic models) that allowed us to calculate the area/length of paleogeographically reconstructed polygons/lines within different latitude bands through time. By pairing this workflow with a database of ophiolite-bearing sutures and a paleogeographic model, we were able to identify a strong correlation between arc-continent collisions in the tropics (measured as active suture length in the tropics) and times of glacial climate over the past $\sim$520~m.y. This correlation led to our proposal that Earth's climate state is set primarily by global weatherability, which changes with the latitudinal distribution of arc-continent collisions. Similarly, it has been proposed elsewhere that the eruption/drift of large igneous provinces into the tropics has driven global cooling. The pyGPlates workflow that I developed provided a means through which we could evaluate this hypothesis. \citet{Park2019a} builds upon the zonal large igneous province area analysis that I conducted and presented in the supplementary materials for \citet{Macdonald2019a} by more rigorously developing parameterizations of large igneous province erosion and exploring several geologically reasonable large igneous province post-emplacement scenarios.

\citet{Park2019a} is currently available as a preprint on EarthArXiv, but a slightly modified version of the article is scheduled to be formally published within 2020 as Chapter 7 of AGU Geophysical Monograph Series 255, titled \textit{Large Igneous Provinces: A Driver of Global Environmental and Biotic Changes}, edited by Richard E. Ernst, Alexander J. Dickson, and Andrey Bekker.

Code used to perform the analyses presented in these articles are available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/Swanson-Hysell-Group/Arc_Continent_Analysis} and \url{https://github.com/Swanson-Hysell-Group/2020_large_igneous_provinces}, or on Zenodo at \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2636731} and \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3981262}.

\subsubsection*{Chapter 2 - Emergence of the Southeast Asian islands as a driver for Neogene cooling}

\noindent
\bibentry{Park2020b}

\bigskip

This article was the result of a collaboration between Godd\'eris' and Swanson-Hysell's research groups supported by the France-Berkeley Fund. Broadly speaking, the collaboration was intended to investigate whether numerical Earth system models quantitatively support the hypothesis put forward in \citet{Macdonald2019a} and \citet{Swanson-Hysell2017a} that tropical arc-continent collisions set Earth's climate state. The model that we use is the global spatially resolved GEOCLIM model, which estimates changes in steady-state \pCOtwo associated with coupled changes in erosion, chemical weathering, and climatology by linking a silicate weathering model to climate model runs at multiple \pCOtwo levels. In previous versions of the model, Godd\'eris and his collaborators parameterized silicate weathering to be a function of temperature and runoff only, and all bedrock was assigned identical chemical compositions. In a more recent version of the model, Maffre implemented regolith development and soil shielding, which introduced a dependence on erosion rate (and, therefore, topographic slope). While this introduction of regolith development into GEOCLIM is important for assessing the impact of tropical arcâ€“continent collisions on \pCOtwo, the relatively high Ca+Mg concentration in arc rocks relative to other lithologies must also be considered. Therefore, in \citet{Park2020b}, I implemented variable bedrock Ca+Mg concentration into GEOCLIM and quantified the uncertainty in steady-state \pCOtwo that arises from poorly constrained model parameters.

The code for the GEOCLIM model used in this study can be found at \url{https://github.com/piermafrost/GEOCLIM-dynsoil-steady-state/releases/tag/v1.0}. The code that generated the inputs and analyzed the output of the GEOCLIM model can be found at \url{https://github.com/Swanson-Hysell-Group/2020_Southeast_Asian_Islands} or \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4021653}.

\subsubsection*{Chapter 3 - The lead-up to the Sturtian Snowball Earth: Neoproterozoic chemostratigraphy time-calibrated by the Tambien Group of Ethiopia}

\noindent
\bibentry{MacLennan2018a}

\medskip

\noindent
\bibentry{Park2020a}

\bigskip

Chronologically, the work that lead to \citet{MacLennan2018a} and \citet{Park2020a} largely preceded the projects presented in Chapters 1 and 2. In \citet{MacLennan2018a}, we presented the initial geochronologic results that placed temporal constraints on large excursions in the marine \dC record and the initiation of the Sturtian glaciation in a short-format journal. \citet{Park2020a} built upon this work by: thoroughly documenting the geology of the Tambien Group in northern Ethiopia (including the discovery of vast areas of exposures of Sturtian glacial deposits and underlying strata near the town of Samre), presenting additional geochronologic results, assessing diagenesis in carbonate samples, presenting the complete \dC and \SrSr data from the Tambien Group, developing a composite Tonian-Cryogenian \dC and \SrSr chemostratigraphic record, and proposing a model for the initiation of the Sturtian glaciation based on the composite \SrSr chemostratigraphic record, a simple global weathering model, and analyses of the timing and paleolatitude of large igneous province eruptions and arc accretion events. As in \citet{Swanson-Hysell2017a} and \citet{Macdonald2019a}, the model for the initiation of the Sturtian glaciation proposed in \citet{Park2020a} called upon island arc exhumation in the tropics, and was part of the motivation to initiate a collaboration with Godd\'eris' research group.

Code used to perform the analyses presented in these articles is available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/Swanson-Hysell-Group/2019_Tambien_Group}, or on Zenodo at \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3403180}.

\subsubsection*{Chapter 4 - Tonian paleomagnetism from South China permits an inclusive Rodinia or Bitter Springs Stage true polar wander, but not both}

\noindent
\textit{PRE-PRINT CITATION WILL GO HERE}
%\bibentry{Park2020c}

\bigskip

Although \citet{Park2020a} called upon island arc exhumation in the tropics as a critical tectonic boundary condition that allowed for the Sturtian glaciation to take place, a lack of paleomagnetic data to constrain the paleolatitude and configuration of tectonic blocks during the Tonian hampers efforts to quantify changes in global weatherability associated with island arc exhumation during the lead up to the Sturtian glaciation. \citet{Park2020c} develops paleomagnetic data to better constrain the location of one of these tectonic blocks, South China, in the Tonian. South China is a particularly important block to investigate with paleomagnetic data in the context of the Sturtian glaciation because arc-continent collisions are hypothesized to have occurred both within and along the margin of the block during the Tonian. Furthermore, sediments from which paleomagnetic data can be developed exist in South China that span a hypothesized major global tectonic event (Bitter Springs Stage true polar wander) that, if real, has far-reaching implications for the paleogeography of the time.

\citet{Park2020c} is currently available as a preprint on EarthArXiv, and has been submitted to the \textit{Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth} for review.

None of what is presented in this dissertation would have been possible without the support of innumerable people. It would be impossible to list every one of these people here, but nevertheless I note some of the individuals who were key to making the research possible below.

I sincerely appreciate the expert guidance and advice from the professors with whom I worked to push the research forward throughout the years: Mulugeta Alene, Dan Condon, Seth Finnegan, Yves Godd\'eris, Bereket Haileab, Oli Jagoutz, Lorraine Lisiecki, Francis Macdonald, Adam Maloof, Blair Schoene, Daniel Stolper, and Shihong Zhang.

I thank my graduate student and post-doc collaborators, the Swanson-Hysell Group, and my Ph.D. class, not only for discussing research with me, but also for being great friends: Eliel Anttila, Maggie Avery, Alex Charn, Luke Fairchild, Isabel Fendley, Hairuo Fu, Mulubrhan Gebreslassie, Blake Hodgin, Taylor Kilian, Jinsol Kim, Tanis Leonhardi, Nate Lindsey, Scott MacLennan, Pierre Maffre, Alex Robson, Allison Sharrar, Sarah Slotznick, Tadele Tesema, Marissa Tremblay, Hanbiao Xian, and Yiming Zhang.

I thank the EPS staff for dealing with the logistics of research and being a graduate student: Rachel Kowalik and Margie Winn.

And of course a big thank you to the rest of the undergraduate students, graduate students, post-docs, staff, and faculty in the Department of Earth \& Planetary Science at UC Berkeley and elsewhere, who I didn't have the chance to list here.

In terms of the non-Earth Science people in my life, I thank my friends and my partner Yudith Dian for putting up with me through the years. And of course a huge thank you to my family, who dedicated everything to raising me and getting me to where I am today.

Finally, and most importantly, thank you to my advisor Nick Swanson-Hysell, for accepting me into the program to begin with and then tirelessly mentoring me throughout the years. I'm endlessly appreciative that I was able to work with him and learn from him, and honestly I don't think I could have asked for a better advisor. As his first graduating Ph.D. student, I hope that I didn't set the bar too low for those to follow.
